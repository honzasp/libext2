\chapter{Introduction}

To begin with, here is the original goal of this project:

\begin{quote}
  It shall be a library to manipulate ext2 filesystems, maybe even a higher
  layer of abstraction corresponding to file system drivers in an OS (like VFS
  for Linux). The interesting part will be that the interface would be
  non-blocking using futures and promises (single-threaded) in the programming
  language Rust.
\end{quote}

I will briefly describe the problem and the motivation, then I will explain how
and why I failed, discuss the structure of the resulting piece of software,
some technical issues and try to come up with a conclusion (and, indeed, a
morale).
