\chapter{Motivation}

File system is a format for saving hierarchies of large sequences of bytes,
decorated with some metadata, in a linear address space. These formats are
understood by operating systems and abstracted away to provide uniform model of
files.

Ext2 is a file system developed for Linux. Even though it has been mostly
replaced by its newer revisions ext3 and ext4, it remains essentially backwards
compatible (at least for reading). The main difference between ext2 and ext3 is
that the latter supports journaling, which enhances performance and reliability
by storing updates in a journal and replaying them later, while always keeping
the device in a consistent state.

\section{Non-blocking IO}

Non-blocking IO (also referred to as asynchronous IO) means that a thread
willing to perform an IO operation is not suspended until the operation
finishes, but immediately continues executing. Later, when the operating system
finishes the request, the thread is notified and can handle the results. This is
usually accomplished by having the thread sitting in an event-loop, waiting for
events from the OS and dispatching them to registered handlers.

The other approach, blocking IO, is more usual, but has various downsides.
First, while the process is waiting for an IO to happen, it is blocked and
cannot get other things done. This works fine for processes that start by
reading input, then get hot for a while and finish by writing output, it would
be disastrous for any (soft) real-time process that has to respond to requests
coming from the outside.

The only way to make things happen while your thread is blocked is to spawn
another thread. To do $n$ things at once, you need at least $n$ threads.
However, there are few tools widely available in modern programming environments
as dangerous as a thread. It is nearly impossible for mere mortals to properly
coordinate so many threads and avoid all race conditions. Moreover, when the $n$
things to be done are just waiting for events, we are paying the non-negligible
cost of a thread only to make it sleep 99.9~\% of its lifetime.

Event-driven programming avoids the thread coordination hell, because there is
only one thread running at a time, so no race conditions can occur while an
event handler is executing. On the other hand, the sequencing constructs
provided by the programming language can no longer be used to sequence IO. For
example, when we want to load a list of funny pictures, blend them together and
save them to a file using blocking IO, we can use the usual tools of our
programming language:\footnote{In the code, I use \texttt{\textbackslash} to say
$\lambda$, because \LaTeX is, well, complicated.}

\begin{ttcode}
blend_pictures = \(files) {
  pictures = for file in files { read_picture(file) }
  blended = blend_pictures(pictures)
  write_picture(blended, "blended.jpg")
}
\end{ttcode}

Note that the usual tools for composing computations worked well for composing
IO operations. On the other hand, when we use callbacks to achieve the same
effects with non-blocking IO, we end up with something like: \footnote{Of
course, this works only if we have a garbage collector, so that the values
captured in the closures do not get destroyed too early.}

\begin{ttcode}
blend_pictures = \(files, blend_callback) {
  load_pictures = \(files, pictures, load_callback) {
    if empty?(files)
      load_callback(pictures)
    else
      read_picture(head(files), \(picture) {
        load_pictures(tail(files), cons(picture, pictures), load_callback)
      })
  }

  load_pictures(reverse(files), \(pictures) {
    blended = blend_pictures(pictures)
    write_picture(blended, "blended.jpg", blend_callback)
  }
}
\end{ttcode}

It is instructive to see that when imperative constructs fail, the functional
come to the rescue.\footnote{Another instance of this phenomenon is so-called
Visitor desing pattern -- this is exactly the way how variants are encoded in
pure $\lambda$-calculus. For me, using such a convoluted way to encode something
so obvious feels like I needed to write \texttt{[->+<]} to move a value between
variables :-)} Indeed, help comes from the language that has no imperative
constructs -- Haskell -- in the form of \texttt{IO} monad. When we use a monad
only to capture the results and allow ourselves side-effects, such a monad is
called a future: 

\begin{ttcode}
blend_pictures = \(files) {
  future_map(files, \(file) {
    read_picture(file) 
  }).then(\(pictures) {
    blended = blend_pictures(pictures)
    write_picture(blended, "blended.jpg")
  })
}
\end{ttcode}

A future represents a computation whose result will be known in the future.
Futures can be composed to produce other futures using various combinators (like
\texttt{future_map} or \texttt{.then} in our example). They allow us to use
non-blocking IO with little cognitive overhead compared to blocking IO.

\section{Rust}

Rust is a systems programming language developed at Mozilla Research. It
guarantees memory safety without garbage collector by statically checking
ownership of values and lifetimes of references. The type system also prevents
data races between threads. Compared to \Cplusplus, probably its closest
competitor, it is much more modern, featuring type inference, traits (similar to
type classes in Haskell), rich data types and pattern matching, to name a few.

\section{Personal motivation}

In summer 2015, I was working for a startup named Bileto on a public transport
routing engine. The engine was written in \Cplusplus, because the speed of the
algorithm was crucial. However, the service needed to communicate with many
other servers over the network, so that the size code that managed the
communication exceeded the size of the algorithms that did the actual work. This
IO code was originally using blocking IO and many threads, but I rewrote it to
non-blocking using \texttt{libev} and a home-made library of futures and
promises.

I knew and used Rust before for my personal projects, mainly for a compiler that
I developed for my maturita exam, so I naturally was quite interested in how
Rust could be used to solve similar problems.
